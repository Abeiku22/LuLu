  <p>Drink to me only with thine eyes,
And I will pledge with mine</p>
<p>But thou thereon didst only breathe,And sentst it back to me</p><p>
Since when it grows and smells, I swear,
Not of itself, but thee</p>
<p>Were all a little weird. And life is a little weird. And when we</p>
<p>find someone whose weirdness is compatible with ours, 
  we join up with them</p><p>and fall into mutually satisfying weirdness—and call it love—true love.</p>
  <p>Sometimes, your nearness takes my breath away, and all the things </p>
    <p>I want to say can find no voice. Then, 
    in silence, I can only hope my eyes will speak my heart.</p>
